    "* Frame the problem as a 'self-play' problem. Each agent recieves it's own **local** observation, so we can train 1 agent to accept both observations and to generate an output.\n",
    "* Share the same actor network and DON'T condition on other agent states. (May need to condition on other agent states for collaborative actions when using only the actor model. If so, the agent must have visibility into the other agent's position. If we don't need it, then perhaps the agent's policys implicitly understand where their partner will likely move given the Q-value function was shared and had full visibility while learning).\n",
    "* Share the same critic network, but use a 'state_set' that conditions estimates of Q(s', state_set, a) on model parameters AND the shared set of states of all agents in the network.\n",
    "    * After initial implementation, it was observed that no learning (or slow learning given the right exploration parameters were set) occured in this methodology. One potential reason for this is that the states are environment states and not agent states. So adding a 'state_set' is not enough to collaboratively share information. Rather, as proposed in the MARL paper, we can instead condition the Q function to instead work by conditioning on a set of actions so that Q is Q(s', a1, a2, ..., an) -> value of action i.\n",
    "    * The reality here is that the actions tie in more implicit information into the policy for acting than just the state set alone.\n",
